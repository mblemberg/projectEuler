Project Euler problem #4

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Will start with 999*999 and work downwards.
Check each number to see if it is a palindrome.
For each palindrome, factor it starting with the number itself and working down to 1.
When you find a number which is the product of two numbers > 99, stop.
